AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform
Problem Statement
In today’s competitive hiring ecosystem, interview readiness is no longer just about
subject knowledge - it is about adaptability, communication, time management,
consistency, and performance under pressure.
Despite access to abundant learning resources, most students struggle during real
interviews due to:
● Lack of realistic interview practice
● Unstructured or subjective feedback
● No measurement of performance under time pressure
● Inability to adapt to varying interview difficulty
● No clear indicator of interview readiness
Traditional mock interviews are often manual, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. As a
result, many capable candidates fail not because of lack of skill - but due to lack of
structured interview preparedness.
The Challenge
Build an AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform that simulates a real-world interview
environment using an AI Interviewer.
The system should evaluate a candidate based on their resume, job description (JD),
responses, time management, and adaptability, and objectively measure interview
performance using predefined rules - just like a real interviewer would.
Your AI Interviewer should not just ask questions, but think, adapt, evaluate, and decide
